# Literature Classification and Its Text Summarization

The idea of building this project is to  provide a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and researchers who need to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field. Overall, this project can help us gain insights into the patterns and trends in COVID-19 research

## Hypothesis
1. Is it possible to obtain a summary of the article while ensuring that no important information is left out?
1. Can grouping research articles that are similar through  clustering make it easier to find related publications?
